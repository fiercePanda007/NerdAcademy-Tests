   const yourPage = () => {

   const [isSidebarVisible, setIsSidebarVisible] = useState(false);
   const toggleSidebar = () => {
      setIsSidebarVisible(!isSidebarVisible);
      };

         .......................................
         ....................................... //your code here...
