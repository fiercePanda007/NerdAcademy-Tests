# FAQ

### 1. 1. How to Add a New File or Directory to the Project?

      Step 1: Create the File or Directory
              Add your new file or directory to the project as needed.

      Step 2: Register the File or Directory in the Layout
              Next, add the path to your file or directory in app/_layout.tsx to ensure proper navigation. Use relative paths from the app directory.
      Example:

```bash
   //@app/_layout.tsx

   export default function RootLayout() {
      return (
         <Stack screenOptions={{ headerShown: false }}>
               {/* Other existing routes */}
               .........................................
            <Stack.Screen name="PATH-To-Your-FILE-Or-DIRECTORY" /> {/* Use this path for navigation */}
         </Stack>

         );
      }

```

\*tips1:While enlisting your file or directory into our project please note that you SHOULD use paths relative to the [app] directory.

\*tips2: Use the same path you registered here in a Link tag to navigate between pages.

### 2. How to integrate Sidebar in your file ?

      step 1: import sidebar Component in your file using relative path like this:


      import Sidebar from "./../../../components/SimpleSidebar";  // Adjust the path relative to your current directory


      step 2: You need to pass a state handler to the Sidebar component for visibility control. Hereâ€™s a sample implementation:



      const yourPage = () => {

         const [isSidebarVisible, setIsSidebarVisible] = useState(false);
         const toggleSidebar = () => {
            setIsSidebarVisible(!isSidebarVisible);
         };

            {/* your code here... */}

         return (
            <Sidebar isVisible={isSidebarVisible} toggleSidebar={toggleSidebar} />
                     {/* your code here... */}
            )
         }


      tips : The sidebar component should be styled appropriately to fit within your pageâ€™s layout. You may need to adjust the marginLeft or other CSS properties to ensure the sidebar is correctly placed without overlapping your content
